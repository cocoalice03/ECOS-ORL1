# Vercel Deployment Failure - Debug Report

## Status: CRITICAL - All Serverless Functions Failing

### Symptoms
- **ALL** Vercel serverless endpoints return: `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`
- This includes:
  - `/api/health` (main application health check)
  - `/api/test` (minimal test endpoint with ZERO dependencies)
  - `/api/auth/firebase-login` (Firebase authentication)

### Key Finding
Even a **minimal test endpoint** with no dependencies or imports is failing:
```javascript
// api/test.js - STILL FAILS
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'OK' });
}
```

**Conclusion**: This is NOT a code issue. It's a Vercel deployment/runtime issue.

### Investigation Timeline

1. **Initial Diagnosis**: Suspected Firebase Admin SDK import issues
   - Fixed: Added dynamic imports to Firebase Admin Service
   - Result: Still failed

2. **Second Attempt**: Suspected module-level Firebase initialization
   - Fixed: Completely removed Firebase imports from routes.ts
   - Result: Still failed

3. **Critical Discovery**: Created minimal test endpoint
   - **MINIMAL CODE STILL FAILS**
   - This proves the issue is NOT in our application code

### Possible Root Causes

#### 1. Vercel Build Configuration Issue
- `vercel.json` specifies custom build/output directories
- `buildCommand`: "npm run build"
- `outputDirectory`: "dist/public"
- Runtime: `@vercel/node@5.3.13`

**Hypothesis**: Build artifacts might not be in the expected location for Vercel

#### 2. ESM/CommonJS Compatibility
- package.json has `"type": "module"` (ESM)
- All `.js` files treated as ES modules
- Bundled code uses `import` statements for external deps

**Hypothesis**: Vercel's Node runtime might have ESM resolution issues

#### 3. Missing node_modules in Serverless Environment
- External dependencies (express, firebase-admin, etc.) need to be installed
- `installCommand`: "npm install" is specified
- But deployment might not be including node_modules properly

**Hypothesis**: Vercel isn't installing dependencies or finding them at runtime

#### 4. Function Cold Start Timeout
- `maxDuration`: 30 seconds
- But even simple functions are failing instantly

**Hypothesis**: Less likely, but possible if initialization is blocking

### Build Artifacts Analysis

The `api/` directory contains:
```
api/
├── _lib/
│   ├── serverless-app.js (499KB - bundled)
│   └── serverless-app.js.map
├── index.js (entry point)
├── scenarios.js
├── generate-criteria.js
├── test.js (minimal test)
├── server/ (copied during build)
└── shared/ (copied during build)
```

**Problem**: The `server/` and `shared/` directories in `api/` might be confusing Vercel's module resolution.

### What Works Locally
- ✅ `npm run dev` - Development server works perfectly
- ✅ Firebase authentication works locally
- ✅ Database connections work locally
- ✅ All routes respond correctly locally

### What Fails on Vercel
- ❌ **ALL** `/api/*` endpoints
- ❌ Even minimal test endpoints
- ❌ Health checks
- ❌ Static file serving might work (not tested)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Simplify Vercel Configuration**
   - Remove custom `buildCommand`
   - Remove custom `outputDirectory`
   - Let Vercel use defaults

2. **Test with Vercel's Standard Setup**
   - Move `api/index.js` to be a simple handler
   - Don't use bundled serverless-app.js
   - Import directly from source files

3. **Check Vercel Logs in Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dave234561s-projects/ecos-orl-1
   - Click on latest deployment
   - View Function Logs to see actual error

4. **Try Different Runtime Version**
   - Current: `@vercel/node@5.3.13`
   - Try: Latest (`@vercel/node`) or older version

5. **Verify Dependencies Installation**
   - Check if Vercel is actually running `npm install`
   - Verify node_modules exists in deployment
   - Check if external dependencies are accessible

### Questions for User

1. Can you access Vercel dashboard and check the function logs?
2. Have you deployed this project successfully to Vercel before?
3. Is this a new project or an existing one that was working?
4. Are there any Vercel-specific environment configurations we're missing?

### Local vs Production Differences

| Aspect | Local | Vercel |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Node.js | Latest LTS | Vercel runtime version |
| Module Resolution | Works | Fails |
| Dependencies | Installed | Unknown if installed |
| Build Process | Manual `npm run build` | Automated by Vercel |
| Serverless | N/A | Cold start + execution |

### Temporary Workaround
None available - entire API is down on Vercel.

### Priority
**P0 - CRITICAL**: Production deployment completely non-functional.
